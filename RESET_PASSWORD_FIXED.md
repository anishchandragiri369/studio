# Reset Password Page - Fixed with Working Version from cb56c78

## Problem
The reset password page was stuck on "Resetting..." and not redirecting after successful password reset, despite previously working in commit cb56c78.

## Root Cause
The current implementation had become overly complex with:
- Multiple state management patterns that caused conflicts
- Excessive debug logging and state tracking
- Complex hash parameter parsing logic
- Multiple useEffect hooks that could cause race conditions
- Over-engineered session establishment logic

## Solution
Reverted to the working implementation from commit cb56c78 which uses a much simpler approach:

### Key Differences in Working Version:

1. **Simplified Token Handling**
   - Only uses `searchParams.get()` for tokens (no hash parsing)
   - Direct access to `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `token`, and `type`

2. **Simple Session Management**
   - Uses `exchangeCodeForSession()` for recovery tokens
   - Direct `setSession()` for access tokens
   - Single state: `sessionReady`

3. **Cleaner useEffect**
   - Single useEffect for recovery handling
   - No complex dependency arrays
   - No race conditions

4. **Straightforward Form Submission**
   - Simple validation
   - Direct password update with `supabase.auth.updateUser()`
   - Clear success/error handling

### Working Flow:
1. User clicks reset link from email
2. Supabase redirects to `/reset-password` with tokens in URL params
3. Component checks for recovery token and exchanges it for session
4. User enters new password
5. Password is updated using established session
6. User is redirected to login page

## Files Changed
- `src/app/reset-password/page.tsx` - Restored to working version from cb56c78
- Fixed minor linting issues (removed unused variables, added proper labels)

## Testing
- No compilation errors
- All linting issues resolved
- Ready for manual testing with actual password reset flow

The working version is much simpler and focuses on the core functionality without unnecessary complexity.
