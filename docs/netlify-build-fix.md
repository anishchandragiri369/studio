# Netlify Build Fix - TOML Configuration Error

## 🔧 **Problem Fixed**
The Netlify build was failing with a TOML parsing error:
```
Unterminated inline array at row 25, col 8, pos 479:
24:     jobs = [
25>       {
           ^
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**
Updated `netlify.toml` with correct TOML syntax for scheduled functions.

### Before (Incorrect):
```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cron"
  [plugins.inputs]
    jobs = [
      {
        name = "daily-subscription-report",
        cron = "0 18 * * *",
        command = "curl -X POST https://..."
      }
    ]
```

### After (Correct):
```toml
# Scheduled function configuration
# This function will run daily at 6 PM (18:00 UTC)
[functions."daily-subscription-report-cron"]
  schedule = "0 18 * * *"
```

## 📋 **Current netlify.toml Configuration**
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/webhook/payment-confirm"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/payment-confirm"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/webhook/payment-confirm/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/payment-confirm"
  status = 200
  force = true

[build]
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  command = "npm run build"

[functions]
  external_node_modules = ["exceljs", "nodemailer"]

# Scheduled function configuration
# This function will run daily at 6 PM (18:00 UTC)
[functions."daily-subscription-report-cron"]
  schedule = "0 18 * * *"
```

## 🚀 **Deploy Steps**

### 1. **Add Environment Variables to Netlify**
In your Netlify dashboard > Site settings > Environment variables, add:

```env
CRON_SECRET=623483794bc94eb44b2d33fa0cad9cfcbd0123e07b45cc041ba22a558c124269e
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
ADMIN_EMAIL_CC=optional_cc_email
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
```

### 2. **Verify Scheduled Function**
The function `netlify/functions/daily-subscription-report-cron.js` will:
- Automatically run daily at 6 PM UTC
- Call your `/api/daily-subscription-report` endpoint
- Send Excel reports via email
- Log success/failure in Netlify function logs

### 3. **Test the System**
After deployment, you can test:

**Manual Admin Download:**
1. Go to `/admin/reports`
2. Click "Download Excel Report"
3. File downloads with all subscription data

**Manual Email Test:**
1. Go to `/admin/reports`
2. Click "Send Email Report"
3. Check admin email for report

**Scheduled Function Test:**
1. Check Netlify function logs after 6 PM
2. Verify email is received
3. Or manually test: `/api/test-daily-report`

## 🔍 **Monitoring & Troubleshooting**

### Check Netlify Function Logs:
1. Netlify Dashboard > Functions
2. Click on `daily-subscription-report-cron`
3. View execution logs and errors

### Test Endpoints:
- **`/api/test-admin`** - Test admin functionality
- **`/api/test-daily-report`** - Manual report trigger
- **`/api/admin-download-report`** - Direct Excel download
- **`/api/admin-send-report`** - Manual email trigger

### Common Issues:
1. **Environment variables not set**: Add all required vars to Netlify
2. **Email not sending**: Check SMTP credentials and Gmail app passwords
3. **Cron not running**: Check Netlify function logs and schedule syntax
4. **Admin access denied**: Verify admin email is configured correctly

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

4. **Verify scheduled reports are working**
5. **Monitor function logs** for any issues
