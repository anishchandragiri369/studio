## Database Schema

### Orders Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  status TEXT,
  order_type TEXT,
  items JSONB,
  shipping_address JSONB,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  email TEXT,
  customer_info JSONB,
  subscription_info JSONB,
  rating_submitted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

## Usage Examples

### Filtering Orders by Date Range
1. Set the "From Date" to the desired start date
2. Set the "To Date" to the desired end date
3. Orders will automatically filter to show only those within the range

2. Results will show all orders for that customer
3. Can combine with other filters for more specific results

### Exporting Order Data

2. Click "Export CSV" button
3. File will download with filtered order data

### Viewing Order Details
1. Click "View Details" on any order card
2. Modal opens with comprehensive order information
3. Navigate between tabs to see different aspects of the order

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

### Audit Trail
- All admin actions are logged
- Order modifications are tracked
- Export activities are recorded

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Queries
