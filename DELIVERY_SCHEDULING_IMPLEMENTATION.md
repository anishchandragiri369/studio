# Delivery Scheduling System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive delivery scheduling system for subscription plans that enforces a 6 PM cutoff rule and generates accurate daily reports based on actual delivery dates.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. 6 PM Cutoff Rule
- **Before 6 PM**: Orders placed before 6 PM get first delivery the next day
- **After 6 PM**: Orders placed after 6 PM get first delivery the day after next
- **Delivery Pattern**: Subscriptions deliver every OTHER day (1-day gap between deliveries)
- **Sunday Exclusion**: No deliveries on Sundays - automatically moved to Monday
- **Consistent Logic**: Applied to both one-time orders and subscription plans

### 2. Delivery Scheduling Engine (`src/lib/deliveryScheduler.ts`)
- `calculateFirstDeliveryDate()`: Calculates first delivery based on order time and 6 PM cutoff
- `generateSubscriptionDeliveryDates()`: Generates complete delivery schedule for subscription period with 1-day gaps
- `getDeliveryDatesForDateRange()`: Filters deliveries for specific date ranges (used in reports)
- Support for daily (with gaps), weekly, and monthly subscription frequencies
- Automatic Sunday exclusion and Monday rescheduling

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- **Orders Table**: Added `first_delivery_date`, `is_after_cutoff`, `delivery_schedule` columns
- **User Subscriptions Table**: Added same delivery scheduling columns for compatibility
- **Indexes**: Added for efficient querying on delivery dates
- **Migration Files**: 
  - `sql/add_delivery_scheduling_columns.sql`
  - `sql/add_delivery_scheduling_to_subscriptions.sql`

### 4. Updated APIs

#### Order Creation (`src/app/api/orders/create/route.ts`)
- Calculates delivery dates for subscription orders using new scheduling system
- Stores complete delivery schedule in database
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing orders

#### Subscription Creation (`src/app/api/subscriptions/create/route.ts`)
- Uses new delivery scheduling instead of legacy SubscriptionManager
- Creates delivery records based on calculated schedule
- Returns delivery information to frontend

#### Daily Subscription Report (`src/app/api/daily-subscription-report/route.ts`)
- Enhanced to filter deliveries by actual delivery dates (not just next_delivery_date)
- Two-sheet Excel reports:
  1. **All Subscriptions**: Traditional subscription overview
  2. **Daily Deliveries**: Orders scheduled for specific delivery date
- Date-based filtering for accurate daily reports
- Email improvements with delivery scheduling information

### 5. User Interface Updates

#### Subscription Page (`src/app/subscriptions/page.tsx`)
- Added delivery information card showing 6 PM cutoff rule
- Real-time calculation of user's next delivery date
- Visual indicators for cutoff times and delivery dates

#### Admin Test Page (`src/app/admin/delivery-test/page.tsx`)
- Test interface for delivery scheduling system
- Manual report generation with date selection
- Scenario testing for different order times
- Visual results display

### 6. Test API (`src/app/api/test-delivery-scheduler/route.ts`)
- GET endpoint: Test specific delivery scenarios
- POST endpoint: Batch test multiple scenarios
- Useful for debugging and validation

## How It Works

### Order Flow
1. **Order Placed**: User places subscription order at any time
2. **Cutoff Check**: System checks if current time is before/after 6 PM
3. **Date Calculation**: First delivery date calculated based on cutoff rule
4. **Schedule Generation**: Complete delivery schedule generated for subscription period
5. **Storage**: All delivery information stored in database
6. **Confirmation**: User sees their delivery schedule

### Report Generation
1. **Daily Trigger**: Reports generated daily (can specify date)
2. **Data Filtering**: Orders filtered by actual delivery dates for target day
3. **Excel Generation**: Two-sheet report with delivery details
4. **Email Delivery**: Sent to admin with enhanced delivery information

### Database Design
```sql
-- Orders table (enhanced)
orders: {
  id, user_id, email, total_amount, items, status,
  order_type, subscription_info,
  first_delivery_date,        -- When deliveries start
  is_after_cutoff,           -- Order placed after 6 PM?
  delivery_schedule: {       -- Complete schedule (JSONB)
    startDate, endDate,
    deliveryDates: [array],
    totalDeliveries
  }
}

-- User Subscriptions table (enhanced)
user_subscriptions: {
  existing_fields...,
  first_delivery_date,
  is_after_cutoff,
  delivery_schedule
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Visit**: `/admin/delivery-test`
2. **Test Scenarios**: Click "Run Delivery Test" to test different order times
3. **Generate Reports**: Select date and download daily reports
4. **Verify Results**: Check Excel files for accurate delivery filtering

### API Testing
```bash
# Test delivery scheduler
GET /api/test-delivery-scheduler?frequency=weekly&duration=4

# Generate report for specific date
GET /api/daily-subscription-report?date=2025-06-30

# Test scenarios
POST /api/test-delivery-scheduler
{
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "duration": 4,
  "orderTime": "2025-06-29T19:00:00Z"
}
```

## Migration Steps

### Required Database Changes
```sql
-- Run these SQL scripts in your database:
1. sql/add_delivery_scheduling_columns.sql
2. sql/add_delivery_scheduling_to_subscriptions.sql
```

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Existing email configuration is reused.

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Delivery Planning**: Reports now show actual delivery dates, not estimated ones
2. **Better Customer Experience**: Clear communication about delivery times
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Kitchen can plan based on accurate daily delivery reports
4. **Flexibility**: System supports daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing subscriptions continue to work
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete delivery schedule stored for each order

## Future Enhancements

1. **SMS Notifications**: Send delivery reminders based on schedule
2. **Delivery Tracking**: Mark deliveries as completed and update status
3. **Holiday Handling**: Skip deliveries on holidays and reschedule
4. **Customer Portal**: Let customers view their delivery schedule
5. **Driver App Integration**: Mobile app showing daily delivery routes
