# ✅ Build Errors Resolved - All Builds Successful

## 🎯 Build Commands Executed

### ✅ Standard Build (`npm run build`)
- **Status:** ✅ Successful
- **Build Time:** ~11-13 seconds
- **Output Size:** 94 static pages generated
- **Warnings:** Only minor Supabase dependency warnings (non-critical)

### ✅ Server Build (`npm run build:server`)
- **Status:** ✅ Successful  
- **Build Time:** ~12 seconds
- **Server Mode:** Configured for dynamic server rendering
- **Output:** All API routes and pages properly built

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Error in `account/subscriptions/page.tsx` ✅

**Problem:**
```typescript
Type error: Property 'street' does not exist on type CheckoutAddressFormData
// Code was trying to access: 
subscription.delivery_address.street
subscription.delivery_address.pincode
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Fixed to use correct property names:
subscription.delivery_address.addressLine1
subscription.delivery_address.zipCode
```

**Root Cause:** The delivery address type uses `addressLine1` and `zipCode` fields, not `street` and `pincode`.

### 2. TypeScript Error in `api/admin/test-delivery-logic/route.ts` ✅

**Problem:**
```typescript
Type error: Argument of type '{ from: string; to: string; gapDays: number; isValid: boolean; }' 
is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Added explicit type annotation:
dayGaps: [] as Array<{
  from: string;
  to: string;
  gapDays: number;
  isValid: boolean;
}>
```

**Root Cause:** TypeScript couldn't infer the array type from an empty array initialization.

## 📊 Build Results

```
Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression
Import trace: @supabase/realtime-js -> @supabase/supabase-js
```
**Note:** This is a known Supabase warning and doesn't affect functionality.
