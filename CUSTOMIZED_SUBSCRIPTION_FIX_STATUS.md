# Customized Subscription Fix - Implementation Status

## Problem
"Weekly Customized Plan" subscriptions (with both juices and fruit bowls) were not being created in the `user_subscriptions` table after payment confirmation, while other plans (juice-only, fruit-bowl-only) worked correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Payment webhook was missing selectedFruitBowls**: The payment confirmation webhook was not passing `selectedFruitBowls` to the subscription creation API.
2. **API was missing selectedFruitBowls support**: The subscription creation API did not accept `selectedFruitBowls` in the request body.
3. **Database schema was missing column**: The `user_subscriptions` table only had `selected_juices` but no `selected_fruit_bowls` column.

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Payment Webhook Fixed (`netlify/functions/payment-confirm.js`)
- **Line 240**: Added `selectedFruitBowls: subscriptionData.selectedFruitBowls || []` to the subscription creation payload
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### 2. ‚úÖ Subscription API Fixed (`src/app/api/subscriptions/create/route.ts`)
- **Line 35**: Added `selectedFruitBowls` to the destructured request body
- **Line 155**: Added `selected_fruit_bowls: selectedFruitBowls ?? []` to the subscription data object
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Database Schema Update Required
- **File**: `sql/add_fruit_bowls_to_subscriptions.sql` (created)
- **Changes needed**:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE user_subscriptions 
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS selected_fruit_bowls JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;
  
  UPDATE user_subscriptions 
  SET selected_fruit_bowls = '[]'::jsonb 
  WHERE selected_fruit_bowls IS NULL;
  
  ALTER TABLE user_subscriptions 
  ADD CONSTRAINT check_selected_fruit_bowls_is_array 
  CHECK (jsonb_typeof(selected_fruit_bowls) = 'array');
  ```
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING - Needs to be executed on database

## Testing Done

### 1. ‚úÖ Webhook Processing Test
- Created `test-webhook-customized.js` to simulate webhook processing
- **Results**: 
  - ‚úÖ Webhook correctly extracts both `selectedJuices` and `selectedFruitBowls`
  - ‚úÖ Webhook passes both to subscription creation API
  - ‚úÖ Payload structure is correct for customized subscriptions

### 2. ‚úÖ Code Analysis
- **Webhook**: ‚úÖ Properly processes mixed subscription data
- **API**: ‚úÖ Accepts both juice and fruit bowl selections
- **Database**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Schema update required

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Subscription Types:
1. **Juice-only plans**: 
   - `selected_juices`: Has data
   - `selected_fruit_bowls`: Empty array `[]`

2. **Fruit bowl-only plans**:
   - `selected_juices`: Empty array `[]`
   - `selected_fruit_bowls`: Has data

3. **Customized plans**:
   - `selected_juices`: Has data
   - `selected_fruit_bowls`: Has data

## Next Steps

### 1. üî• URGENT: Run Database Migration
Execute the SQL migration to add the `selected_fruit_bowls` column:
```bash
# Run this SQL on your Supabase database
psql -h your-db-host -d your-db-name -f sql/add_fruit_bowls_to_subscriptions.sql
```

### 2. üß™ Test End-to-End
1. Create a test order with both juices and fruit bowls
2. Process payment (trigger webhook)
3. Verify subscription is created in `user_subscriptions`
4. Confirm both `selected_juices` and `selected_fruit_bowls` are populated

### 3. üîç Verify Fix
Query the database to ensure customized subscriptions are being created:
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  plan_id, 
  selected_juices, 
  selected_fruit_bowls,
  array_length(selected_juices, 1) as juice_count,
  array_length(selected_fruit_bowls, 1) as bowl_count
FROM user_subscriptions 
WHERE plan_id = 'weekly-customized'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Files Modified

1. `netlify/functions/payment-confirm.js` - ‚úÖ Updated webhook
2. `src/app/api/subscriptions/create/route.ts` - ‚úÖ Updated API
3. `sql/add_fruit_bowls_to_subscriptions.sql` - ‚úÖ Created migration
4. `test-webhook-customized.js` - ‚úÖ Created test script
5. `test-customized-subscription.js` - ‚úÖ Created test script

## Key Technical Details

### Webhook Processing Flow:
1. Payment webhook receives `PAYMENT_SUCCESS_WEBHOOK`
2. Extracts `order.subscription_info.subscriptionItems`
3. For each item, extracts `subscriptionData.selectedJuices` and `subscriptionData.selectedFruitBowls`
4. Sends both to subscription creation API
5. API stores both in database

### Subscription Type Detection:
The API determines subscription type based on:
- Has juices + no fruit bowls = "juices"
- Has fruit bowls + no juices = "fruit_bowls"  
- Has both = "customized"

## Status: üü° 90% Complete
- ‚úÖ Code fixes complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database migration pending
- üß™ End-to-end testing needed after migration
